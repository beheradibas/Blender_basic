Learning Blender2.79b

This repository contains .blender files made in Blender2.79b when I learned Blender 3D Modelling from Blender Documentation 4th Edition.
Thus, this contains models that have been developed by following step-by-step approaches in the book and changing few params according to match my choice of models.
This may contain few models I did on my own.
Moreover, feel free to use them as you wish.
